x get rid of the run function
x get rid of the bind function
x get rid of the waiters
  x First strategy is to send all tasks to the control loop using a channel
  x As a prerequisite we need to make Control an enum
  - It seems to work but we have to think about it
    - Investigate on how to get rid of it all by awaiting listener and sender
      into listen_tcp
- instanciate clients in control loop
- Control should be renamed to Command
  - Then Control::Packet to Command::Control
- find better than the shutdown flag (control ?)
- control packet only interface even in the main code
- get rid of broker
- Eventually, check for documentation in server and mod
